<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>
1 cup whole milk yogurt
Kosher salt
2 teaspoons Kashmiri chili powder (see Cook's Note)
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 1/2 pounds bone-in skinless chicken thighs
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 large red onions, thinly sliced
2 cups basmati rice
8 whole cloves
7 green cardamom pods
3 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
2 large pinches saffron
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
5 cloves garlic, finely grated
2 medium tomatoes, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup cilantro leaves
1/2 cup mint leaves
</p>
<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<p>*Whisk together the yogurt, 3 tablespoons salt, chili powder and turmeric in a large bowl.<br>*Add the chicken and turn to coat.<br>*Let sit at room temperature until ready to use, up to 1 hour. <br>*(Alternatively, the chicken can be marinated for up to 2 days covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator.)
<br>*Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 350 degrees F. <br>*Fry half of the onions, stirring frequently for even cooking, until deep golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. <br>*Transfer them to a paper-towel lined baking sheet to drain. <br>*Season with salt and let cool. <br>*Let the oil come back up to temperature and repeat with the remaining onions. Reserve the oil.
<br>*Wash, rinse and drain the rice in a bowl full of cold water until the water is almost clear, about 5 times. <br>*Bring the rice, 1/4 cup salt, 4 of the cloves, 3 of the cardamom pods, 1 of the bay leaves, the peppercorns and 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. <br>*Cook for exactly 5 minutes. (The rice will not be completely cooked; it will continue to cook in the oven. Do not cook longer or the rice will get mushy.) <br>*Drain and transfer the rice and spices to a medium bowl.
<br>*Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F.
<br>*Stir together the saffron and milk in a small bowl until combined.
<br>*Heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved onion oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. <br>*Add the cinnamon stick, cumin seeds and the remaining 4 cloves, 4 cardamom pods and 2 bay leaves. <br>*Cook, stirring frequently, until the spices are very fragrant and beginning to brown, about 1 minute. <br>*Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until very fragrant and beginning to stick to the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. <br>*Add the tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the garlic and ginger from the bottom of the pan, until the tomatoes start to break down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. <br>*Stir in 1/2 cup water, bring to a boil and scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan.
<br>*Remove the chicken from the marinade and layer on top of the tomatoes. <br>*Then sprinkle half the fried onions on top of the chicken. <br>*Top with the rice and spices and then drizzle the saffron milk over the rice. <br>*Cover the pan and bake until the liquid evaporates, the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes.
<br>*Let sit covered for 10 minutes, then transfer the biryani to a large serving platter. <br>*Top with the remaining fried onions, cilantro and mint leaves.

<h1>Chingri Malai Curry(Prawn Curry)</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chingri malai curry is an iconic Bengali prawn curry made by cooking large tiger prawns (bagda chingri) or giant freshwater prawns (golda chingri) in a super-subtle, super-creamy coconut-milk sauce. </p>
<img src="https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~adhar2/WP/PW/PW01/images%20for%20pw1/prawn-curry-generic_650x400_51491898702.jpg " alt="prawncurry">
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>1 kg bagda or golda chingri (giant tiger or freshwater prawns)
50 g vegetable oil
10 g ghee
200 g onion paste
20 g ginger paste
4 g turmeric
1 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder
75 g yoghurt
6 pcs green chillies
300 g coconut milk (first-press)
200 g coconut milk (second-press)
24 g salt
36 g sugar
½ tsp bengali garam masala </p>
<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<p>*Shell and devein the prawns, leaving the flavourful head intact. You may remove the stomach of the prawn, located near its head. We are leaving the shells on, but you may peel them off if you like.
<br>*Coat prawns with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp turmeric powder, and set aside.
<br>*In a grinder jar, add onions and blitz them to a fine paste. <br>*Also extract coconut milk, reserving the first-press (thick) and second-press (thinner) milk in separate jars, and keep it ready.
<br>*Heat vegetable oil in a pan. Once hot, lower the prawns one by one, and fry them in batches for about 45 seconds on each side. The longer you cook prawns the tougher they’ll become, so remove them from the heat immediately and set aside.
<br>*Now add ghee to the residual oil. Temper with dried red chillies, bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.
<br>*Add onion paste along with sugar, and fry for about 8 minutes until the onions are brown.<br>
*Add ginger paste and fry for another 3–4 minutes, after which add turmeric and kashmiri red chilli powder. <br>*Stir intermittently so that the spices don’t stick to the bottom of the pan. <br>*When they do, add a splash of the thin, second-press coconut milk to loosen the mixture up and help fry it. <br>*Also add three slit green chillies and salt now.
<br>*Once oil starts separating from the spices, beat the yoghurt until it is lump free and add it to the pan. <br>*Drop the heat and stir vigorously to prevent the yoghurt from splitting. <br>*Cook it for 3–4 minutes.
<br>*Add the second-press (thin) coconut milk and simmer for about 2 minutes before adding the first-press (thick) coconut milk. <br>*Once it comes to a boil, add the fried prawns.
<br>*Allow the prawns to bubble in the curry, covered, for no more than 5 minutes.
Finish off with garam masala before serving.</p>
