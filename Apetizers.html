<img src="https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~adhar2/WP/PW/PW01/images%20for%20pw1/chotpoti.jpg " alt="chotpoti">


<h3>Ingredients:</h3>


<p>Chotpoti spice mix:


Roast: Red chili 10- 12 pcs


Coriander seeds 1 tbsp


Cumin seeds 2 tbsp


Black pepper 10 pcs


Cloves 5 pcs


Panch phoron 1/2 tsp


Tamarind Sauce:


Water 1 cup, tamarind pulp 1/2 cup


Black salt to taste


Roasted red chili 1 tsp


Chotpoti spice mix 1 tbsp


Brown sugar 1 tsp


Chat masala


Cheakpea: 1 and 1/2 cup of white vatana or white peas , soaked in water overnight with 1/2 tea spoon baking soda


1 tbl spoon – 1 and 1/2 tbl spoon Chat Masala


1 and 1/2 tea spoon dry roasted cumin powder ( bhaja jeera gura )


1 tea spoon coarsly grounded lightly roasted whole coriander powder ( asto dhonia gura )


3/4 or around 2 tea spoon dry roasted dry red chili powder ( you can add more , depending on your taste)


1 tea spoon rock salt ( bit lobon)


Salt to taste </p>


<h3>Procedure:</h3>


<p>*Soak the chotpoti daal in water overnight with baking soda . Baking soda helps to soften daal easily . But if you have good quality daal , you can skip that part . But don’t forget to soak in water .This is a must. <br>*Wash the daal cery well .


<br>*Boil the daal until creamy, little mushy . If your daal is not creamy , chotpoti won’t taste better . Not only boiled , you need to have the thickness and starch coming out from daal . Don’t add salt at this point as it prevents the daal to be boiled properly .


<br>*What I do , I always prepare the daal in a slowcooker or crockpot . Those who have a slowcooker , please use it . <br>*Use less water than usual than set the temperature to high for 2 hours , then to slow for another 3- 4 hours . Most of the time , <br>*I do it before going to sleep . I set the temperature to low before going bed , in the morning chotpoti looks just perfect .


Those who doesn’t have slow cooker can use pressure cooker too . Faster !!!


<br>*When it is done , add the ingredients mentioned in Part B. Depending on your taste , you can add the dry roasted masalas more or less .


<br>*Don’t mix the ingredients mentioned in Part C until you serve . I always mix them with little amount of chotpoti served , as these ingredients will cause bad smell if kept for longer . Better always serve separately .</p>
