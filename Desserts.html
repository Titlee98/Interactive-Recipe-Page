<h3>Ingredients:</h3>


<p>


3'cup all purpose flour


2 cup hung curd


1/2 cup ghee


3 cup sugar


5 strand saffron


1/2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom


1/2 cup corn flour


1 1/2 pinch baking soda


2 cup sunflower oil


3 cup water


4 drops rose essence


1/2 teaspoon edible food color


</p>


<h3>Procedure:</h3>


<p>*To make this easy Jalebi recipe, mix together all-purpose flour, cornflour and baking soda in a bowl.


<br>*Now, add ghee and food colour to the above mixture and give a mix. <br>*To make a thick batter add hung curd and water.


<br>*Mix well until it is thick but has a slightly flowing consistency. <br>*Keep it aside for 8-10 hours to ferment.


<br>*This step is important to give that unique "khatta" taste to Jalebi. <br>*To make the sugar syrup,


heat water in a pan over medium flame.<br>* Add sugar and mix until fully dissolved. <br>*Simmer the syrup until


it attains one string consistency. <br>*Add saffron, cardamom powder and rose essence. <br>*Stir well to prepare


the final sugar syrup. <br>*This will be used to soak the jalebis and give them their signature sweetness.


<br>*Now, heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep frying. <br>*Fill the jalebi batter in a muslin cloth and


pierce a small hole in the cloth. <br>*You can even use a squeezy bottle (ketchup bottles with a small nozzle on top)


to make jalebis. <br>*Now just squeeze the muslin cloth to make concentric circles. <br>*Move from inside to outside to


make perfect circles. <br>*Fry till jalebis from both the sides until they are crispy in texture and golden in colour.


<br>*Soak the jalebis in sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes in warm sugar syrup. <br>*Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm and


not very hot, as this will make the jalebis limp. <br>*Don't soak the jalebis for too long if you wish to retain


their crispiness. <br>*Now, remove the jalebis from the syrup and place it on a tray lined with butter paper or foil.


<br>*Decorate with silver foil (optional) and serve the jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature with creamy Rabri.


<br>Note: To make the jalebi even more delicious, add a little bit of ghee to the batter, this will give your jalebi


that perfect aroma. To the crispy Jalebi, don't forget to ferment the batter overnight

<img src="https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~adhar2/WP/PW/PW01/images%20for%20pw1/gulab%20jamun.jpeg " alt="gulabjamun">


<h3>Ingredients</h3>


<p>For the Syrup:


2 cups (480ml) water


14 ounces (2 cups; 400g) sugar


1 tablespoon (15ml) lemon juice


1 pinch (15 strands) saffron


4 green cardamom pods, crushed


2 whole cloves


1 teaspoon (5ml) rose water


For the Jamuns:


1.4 ounces (1/4 cup; 40g) fine semolina flour (see note)


1/4 cup (60ml) milk


5.3 ounces (2 cups; 150g) non-fat dried milk powder (see note


1 teaspoon baking powder


1/2 teaspoon ground green cardamom


1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume


6 tablespoons (90ml) heavy cream, divided plus more as needed


3 cups (720ml) grapeseed oil, for frying (see note)


3 tablespoons (25g) chopped pistachios or cashews, for garnish (optional)</p>


<h3>Procedure:</h3>


<p>*For the Syrup: Combine water, sugar, lemon juice, saffron, cardamom, and cloves in a medium saucepan. <br>*Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until a drop of the syrup pressed between two teaspoons forms a sticky, thin thread when spoons are pulled apart, about 5 minutes. <br>*Remove from heat, stir in rose water, cover, and set aside to keep warm.


		 <br>*For the Jamuns: In a small bowl, stir together semolina and milk, and set aside for 30 minutes to allow semolina to soak. <br>*Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. <br>*In a large bowl, whisk together milk powder, baking powder, cardamom, and salt. <br>*Sift mixture twice through a fine-mesh strainer onto prepared baking sheet, using clean hands or a bowl scraper to break up any lumps or bits that might be left behind in the strainer basket.


<br>*Transfer sifted mixture back to large bowl, and make a small well in the center; return sheet of parchment to baking sheet, and set aside. <br>*Add the semolina-milk mixture along with 1/4 cup (60ml) cream to center of well and, using clean hands, mix ingredients to form stiff but sticky dough. <br>*If mixture seems dry, add more cream as needed, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until dough forms. <br>*When mixing, try not to aggressively knead the dough, as the gulab jamuns will become quite dense; instead, press the ingredients gently together with your fingertips to form dough.


<br>*To form jamuns, take 1 tablespoon of dough and roll between palms to shape into a smooth, 1-inch (2.5 cm) ball. <br>*The dough will appear sticky at first, but the heat from your palms will help soften it and make it more pliable. <br>*If any cracks appear on the surface, wet your palm with a drop or two of heavy cream to help shape and smooth out ball. <br>*Place formed jamun on the reserved parchment-lined baking sheet, and repeat forming process with remaining dough (you should end up with 18 balls).


<br>*In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, heat ghee or oil over medium-high heat to 325°F (160°C). <br>*Line a plate with paper towels. <br>*Working in two batches, carefully add half of the dough balls, one at a time, to the hot oil; using a slotted spoon, immediately move each ball as it's added to the oil to prevent them from sticking to bottom of the pot. <br>*Cook, occasionally moving balls around with a slotted spoon to ensure even cooking, until jamuns are golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. <br>*Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate, and allow to rest 30 seconds. <br>*Transfer fried jamuns to saucepan of scented syrup, and cover. <br>*Repeat process with remaining dough balls.


<br>*Let jamuns soak in the syrup, covered, for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. (After the initial 4-hour soak, the gulab jamuns can be transferred along with the syrup to the refrigerator.) <br>*To serve, gently reheat gulab jamuns in the syrup over low heat until warmed through. <br>*Transfer to a platter or individual serving plates, spooning syrup generously over top, and garnish with chopped pistachios or cashews, if using. <br>*Serve immediately.

<h1>Payesh(Rice Pudding)</h1>


<h3>Description</h3>


<p>This Bengali delicacy is a rice-based pudding made on several occasions of Bong community such as baby showers, birthdays, house-warming ceremonies et al. Here is a Step by Step Recipe to make Bengali Chaler Payesh.</p>


<img src="https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~adhar2/WP/PW/PW01/images%20for%20pw1/Bengali-Chaler-Payesh-2.jpg " alt="payesh">


<h3>Ingredients:</h3>


<p>1 litre full fat milk


50 g new gobindobhog rice


150 g nolen gur (date palm jaggery)


¼ tsp salt


20 g cashew


10 g raisins (soaked and drained)


10 g ghee </p>


<h3>Procedure:</h3>


<p>*Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes. Do not overwash the rice as we don’t want to lose too much starch. <br>*After 30 minutes, strain the rice and spread it to dry. <br>*Coat the soaked rice in ¼ tsp of ghee and set aside.


<br>*Soak the raisins in some water to allow them to swell. <br>*Heat ghee in a pan and fry the cashewnuts on medium heat until they are golden. <br>*Remove from the pan and set aside.


<br>*Transfer the milk to a heavy pan or kadai. <br>*On medium heat, wait for it to come to a boil. <br>*After that, reduce the milk for about 15 minutes. <br>*Stir regularly so that the milk does not catch the bottom or sides of the pan.


<br>*Add the ghee-coated rice to the milk and keep cooking on low heat until the rice is fully cooked. <br>*This will require patience, as at several points it will appear as if the rice has cooked. <br>*However, you need to keep boiling


it until you reach a stage where a grain mashed between your fingers faces no resistance at all. <br>*It should be mushy soft, as rice will harden when payesh is cooled. <br>*Stir gently throughout this process. Not only will that ensure


that the payesh doesn’t burn, stirring will also release the starch from the rice, which will help thicken the payesh.


<br>*Now is it is time to add the gur. But you need to be sure of two things before that: <br>*(a) The rice should be fully cooked because after adding the gur, the rice will not cook


any further. <br>*(b) The payesh should be slightly thicker than how you actually want it as gur will loosen it up slightly. <br>*Now turn off the heat and add the gur, along with salt, soaked raisins, and fried cashew.


<br>*Keep heat turned off as any impurities in the gur will cause the milk to split. <br>*Fold everything in and cover the pan. <br>*Allow the residual heat to melt the gur fully. <br>*Serve hot or cool.</p>
